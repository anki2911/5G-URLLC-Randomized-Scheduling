# 5G-URLLC-Randomized-Scheduling

This repository contains the source code of 5G URLLC random schedule generation procedure. This schedule generation phase runs at the 5G base station. Given a set of n flows, m frequencies, a sub-carrier spacing, and $\alpha$ fraction of the slots in the frequency, this scheduler runs online and generates random feasible schedules in each hyperperiod.
